# Simon Game

Welcome to the Simon Game repository! This project represents a web-based implementation of the classic Simon electronic memory game. Test your memory and pattern recognition skills with this interactive and addictive game!

## Game Rules

- The game consists of a sequence of colored buttons that light up and play sounds.
- The player must replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
- The sequence progressively gets longer and more challenging as the game continues.
- A wrong button press ends the game, and the player can choose to start a new game and beat their high score.

## Features

- Interactive Gameplay: Click the colored buttons to replicate the sequence played by the game.
- Randomized Patterns: The game generates random patterns for each round, providing a unique challenge every time.
- Sounds and Visual Cues: Each button lights up and plays a unique sound to help the player remember the sequence.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's current score and their highest score achieved.
- Game Over: When the player makes a mistake, the game ends and displays the final score.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Other Dependencies: Bootstrap, Howler.js (for sound effects), etc.
